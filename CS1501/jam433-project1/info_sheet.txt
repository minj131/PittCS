Does your program run without error?: Yes

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

Compiles and runs without error, but error in logic in implementing the prediction table.



Additional comments to the grader:

Currently, the autocomplete function sometimes does not fully populate the list. I have discovered this bug in situations where any subsequent words is found adjacent more than one side node. The backtracking method does not account for this and I've been having trouble figuring it out. For example:

t
h
e
r
a
p
e
t
i
c
^--a--s
   l
   l
   y
   ^

Above shows a visualization of the trie for the words "therapeutic", "therapeutically", "therepeutics" in lexicographic order.
The autocomplete method must backtrack and recurse using the other side nodes to predict the next words but I was not able to figure 
out the implementation for that. Instead it back tracks to find the next adjacent node from the original successor.

Also an error case arises in some occasion when the backtrack skips over a certain letter. I wanted to investigate this but did not have time. This error can be recreated when searching for "th". It skips over "thalidomide" and populates a different word "thiamine".
