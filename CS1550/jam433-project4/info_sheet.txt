Does your program run without error?: Yes*

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

The program runs as intended by specification. Echo redirection, cat, pico, and touch work as intended
but bash throws a `-bash: echo: write error: Input/output error` message. Again, the methods that are
affected (echo redirection, cat, pico, and touch) work as intended. There might be an issue with
my virtual disk partition and FUSE which is apparently a common issue that people have reported, 
but it also just might be my code implementation. I don't think it's the latter because the input/output is working just fine. When writing out from pico, the same message is thrown but when you run cat on the newly
created file, the input text is still displayed.
